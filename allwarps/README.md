# allwarps
This is an addon for ashita that adds all warps to your homepoints, survival guides, and waypoints menus, regardless of if you have unlocked them or not. You can port to them and then click on the point you warped to to gain "real" access to it.

It has not settings or options. 

```
/addon load allwarps # this gives access to all warps
/addon unload allwarps # this will remove acess to all warps
```
